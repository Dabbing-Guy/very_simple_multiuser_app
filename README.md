# What is this

This is a simple demo app to try out syncing multiple clients using an a central server and an api.

Each client is a user on the server. Each user has a `nickname` and `message`.

The server/api is currently deployed at `very-simple-multiuser-app-api.tk` as a public instance.

To use, simply run the `main.py` file with Python >= 3.9. To scroll the messages, use the arrow up and down keys. To exit, type exit at the message prompt or ctrl+c.
